The plan for me to compelete this task is first darw all the dots as small dots using a loop. (the distance between each dot is "distance") 
Because big dots appear every other dots, so the distance with them is "distance" times 2. So with the loop, we finished all the big dots on the odd rows.
Then we just need to copy the same loop and move the starting point 1 distance down and 1 distance to the right to finish the big dots on the even rows.
